I created a screencast to showcase some of the basic features of [pgcli](http://pgcli.com).

This video covers:

* Installation
* Launching pgcli
* Switching databases
* Basic auto-completion for SELECT, CREATE, INSERT and JOIN statements.
* Expanded output
* Multi-line mode

If there is enough interest, I'll produce a few more screencasts of other
features available in [pgcli](http://pgcli.com). Please reach me via
[twitter](https://twitter.com/amjithr) or [email](mailto:amjith.r@gmail.com) to
provide feedback.

I'm also working on a new project called [mysql-cli](http://mysql-cli.com).
I've launched a
[kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1839007321/mysql-cli)
campaign for that project and I'd like your support. Please forward the
[project](http://mysql-cli.com) to your friends and coworkers.
