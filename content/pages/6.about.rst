:slug: about

Hi, [pgcli](https://www.pgcli.com) is maintained by the members of a secret
coalition bent on world domination. Our fearless leader is [Irina
Truong](https://github.com/j-bennet).

We prioritize being nice more than being right. We built pgcli to make it
pleasant to work with Postgres databases.
