Promise

:slug: promise

Hi, I'm Amjith_. I refuse to be an unpleasant individual on the internet.

I will:
-------

* Be nice.
* Be courteous.
* Be respectful.
* Have an open mind.
* Never be condescending.
* Never discriminate (even if you like Emacs and Windows).

If I ever fail one of the tenets above, please let me know. After all, I am
human.

Exception:
----------

There is one exception. 

I don't react well when someone is being aggressive or insulting. I will
politely let you know that you're being unpleasant and I will stop responding.

Caveats:
--------

1. English is not my native tongue. I'm constantly working to improve my
   english, but I still make grammatical errors when I write. 

2. I also don't fully grasp most slangs, but it never stops me from using it
   ;).  Here's an example, until very recently I thought 'pretty good' meant
   'very good'. So I would compliment my friends that they did a 'pretty good'
   job without knowing that I was mildly insulting them. I'm told 'pretty good'
   means not quite good enough or there is room for improvement.

3. I think I'm funny (no, I think I'm hilarious). Sometimes that might come
   across negatively without proper context. If anything I say offends you,
   please let me know, I'm always learning.

But this is not a cop out, I'd still appreciate if you call me out when I make
a faux paus.
