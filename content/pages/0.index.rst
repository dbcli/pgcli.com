We stand with Ukraine
---------------------

Ukrainian people are fighting for their country. A lot of civilians, women and children, are suffering. Hundreds were killed and injured, and thousands were displaced.

This is an image from my home town, Kharkiv. This place is right in the old city center.

Quick Start
===========

If you already know how to install python packages, then you can simply do:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install pgcli

If you're on macOS you can install it via Homebrew. Just be aware that this will
install postgresql if you don't already have it.

.. code:: bash

   $ brew install pgcli

If you're having trouble with the quick start, check the install_ page for
detailed instructions.
