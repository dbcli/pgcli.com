FAQ 
###

These are some questions that the author wishes everyone would ask, since he
knows the answers for them. 

1. Why did you write pgcli? What's your motivation?

   Bpython, Python Prompt Toolkit.

2. Will there be an equivalent of this for Sqlite?
   
   Probably. Now that I've worked out the hard parts (sqlcompletion and special
   commands), I'd like to write an sqlite CLI. But if you're interested in
   doing it, I'd be happy to help you as well.

3. Will there be an equivalent of this for MySql?

   Probably. Now that I've worked out the hard parts (sqlcompletion and special
   commands), I'd like to write a MySql CLI. But if you're interested in
   doing it, I'd be happy to help you as well.

4. Why is this not version 1.0? 

   The backbone of pgcli is Python-Prompt-Toolkit. That library is still
   evolving, so I'm hesitant to mark pgcli as 1.0. I'll probably release v1.0
   when Python-Prompt-Toolkit goes 1.0.
