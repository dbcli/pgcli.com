Install

:slug: install

Quick start:
------------

If you already know how to install python packages, then you can simply do:
You might need ``sudo``. 

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install pgcli

    or 

    $ easy_install install pgcli

Detailed:
---------

For installing Python packages it is recommended to use the package manager
called ``pip``. There is also an older package manager known as
``easy_install`` but it is superseded by pip.

Check if ``pip`` is installed on the system.

.. code:: bash

    $ which pip

If the above command returns an error, then you do not have pip installed on
your computer. You can install pip for your OS using one of the following
methods.

Linux:
~~~~~~

``pgcli`` uses ``psycopg`` to talk to postgres database. In order to install
psycopg, you will need you will need libpq installed on your system. You will
also need C compiler installed on your system in order to compile the required
files for psycopg.

Debian based systems (Debian, Ubuntu, Mint etc)

.. code:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install libpq-dev
    $ sudo apt-get install python-pip

For Redhat based systems (Fedora, Centos, RHEL etc)

.. code:: bash

    $ sudo yum install python-pip

After this you can simply do:

.. code:: bash

    $ sudo pip install pgcli

Mac OS X:
~~~~~~~~~

``pgcli`` uses ``psycopg`` to talk to postgres database. In order to install
psycopg, you will need you will need libpq installed on your system. The
easiest way to get the necessary libraries is to install postgres on your
system. 

.. code:: bash

    $ brew install postgresql

You will also need C compiler installed on your system in order to compile the
required files for psycopg. So you will need to install XCode and then install
the CommandLineTools which will install gcc or an equivalent C compiler on your
system. I typically do the following: 

.. code:: bash

   $ xcode-select --install     # This will install the command line tools for xcode.

Most OS X systems comes pre-installed with python and ``easy_install``. You can
use easy_install to install ``pip``.

.. code:: bash

    $ sudo easy_install install pip
    
    $ sudo pip install pgcli
