&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://mysql-cli.com"&gt;mysql-cli&lt;/a&gt; will be a command line client for MySQL, with
auto-completion and syntax highlighting. An equivalent of
&lt;a href="http://pgcli.com"&gt;pgcli&lt;/a&gt; for MySQL database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm raising funds for the project through &lt;a href="http://mysql-cli.com"&gt;kickstarter&lt;/a&gt;.
The goal is to compensate for the development time and resources (hosting,
testing infrastructure, etc) as well as motivate me to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I launched pgcli earlier this year I had high hopes for it. I anticipated
that I might reach a hundred users and even a couple of contributions. I
announced it on
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amjithr/status/552491986255896576"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and HackerNews
and it took about an hour to reach 100 stars. By the second day it was a top
trending repo in all of Github. Right now it is hovering near the 1600 mark for
the number of stars, with more than 70 pull requests (merged). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the first week of launch, I slept about 3 hours each night because the
pull requests and issues came flooding. I made a personal resolve to answer
every communique within 24 hours. This meant answering personal emails,
responding to issues filed, reviewing pull requests etc. I
&lt;a href="http://pgcli.com/about"&gt;vowed&lt;/a&gt; to be polite and respectful to my users and
contributors and I've had nothing but pleasant interactions with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hope is to provide the same level of dedication and support to
&lt;a href="http://mysql-cli.com"&gt;mysql-cli&lt;/a&gt;. There is definitely a need for it, since
every time I use the default MySQL client I want to scream obscenities at my
computer and I can't be the only one. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is to launch &lt;a href="http://mysql-cli.com"&gt;mysql-cli&lt;/a&gt; in July 2015 and open
up the repo to public. If you want to get involved sooner, please back the
project on &lt;a href="http://mysql-cli.com"&gt;kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; and I'll add you to the early access list. :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Amjith</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 05 Apr 2015 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>tag:pgcli.com,2015-04-05:mysql-cli-kickstarter.html</guid><category>python</category><category>mysql</category></item></channel></rss>
