    <h1 class="entry-title">FAQ</h1>
    
    <p>These are some questions that the author wishes everyone would ask, since he
knows the answers for them.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first"><strong>Why does pgcli exist?</strong></p>
<p>I'm a huge fan of CLIs. Especially REPLs. When I first encountered
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bpython-interpreter.org/">BPython</a>, I fell in love with it. BPython is a Python REPL that has
auto-completion, syntax-highlighting and displays the docstring of functions
as you type. Once you get used to that level of pampering, all other REPLs
start to look like <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal#Dumb_terminals">Dumb Terminals</a>.</p>
<p>When I started using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/app-psql.html">psql</a> for interacting with my Postgres database, I
yearned for a BPython equivalent for psql.</p>
<p>One fine day I got a twitter DM from <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jonathanslenders">Jonathan Slenders</a> asking me if I'd
be interested in trying a new Python library that he's working on called
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit">Python-Prompt-Toolkit</a>. This library provided a way to write CLIs without
having to deal with curses and had the requisite tools for doing
auto-completion and syntax-highlighting. So I jumped at the opportunity to
try it out. After I got myself familiarized, I started writing pgcli to
scratch my own itch.</p>
<p>So this app exists because Jonathan was kind enough to request my feedback.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Does pgcli work on Windows?</strong></p>
<p>The honest answer is, I don't know. All the underlying libraries used by
pgcli are cross-platform compatible (including Windows). But I have not had
the opportunity to try it on Windows. It is mainly because I don't have a
windows machine to try this and I'm too lazy to try and provision an Azure
instance.</p>
<p>If there is enough interest, I will get off my lazy bum and buy an Azure
instance. Please file bugs if it doesn't work on Windows.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Will there be an equivalent of this for Sqlite/MySql?</strong></p>
<p>Probably. Now that I've worked out the hard parts (sqlcompletion and special
commands), I'd like to write a CLI for Sqlite and MySql. But I'm not sure if
I'll have the time to do it in the immediate future. But if you're
interested in doing it, I'd be happy to help you. Please get in <a class="reference external" href="./about">touch</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>What's the difference between Smart Completion and Naive Completion?</strong></p>
<p>Naive Completion is a collection of all the keywords, functions, table names
and column names. As you start typing this collection will be narrowed down
based on the text that has been types so far.</p>
<p>Smart Completion tries to do context sensitive completion. For eg: 'SELECT *
FROM ' knows that the only items relevant after the FROM keyword is a table
name, so it only suggests items from a collection of table names.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>How 'smart' is the Smart Completion?</strong></p>
<p>Smart Completion uses the <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sqlparse">Sqlparse</a> library to tokenize the sql statement and
uses heuristics to suggest context sensitive completion. It can handle
nearly 80% of scenarios (in my testing). But there are still some corner
cases where it will suggest only keywords when you might be looking for
columns or tables. So it could get frustrating when it refuses to provide
completions from a different category. In those scenarios, I tend to turn it
off (using the F2 key) and switch to Naive completion which suggests words
from all categories.</p>
<p>The code itself is not my proudest work. Writing auto-completion libraries
are inherently difficult since you're dealing with incomplete input. So the
parser can't work effectively in many scenarios. So the code has to
compensate for those corner cases. Which resulted in a lot of testing and
patching those cases with one off 'if-conditions'.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Why is this not version 1.0?</strong></p>
<p>The backbone of pgcli is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit">Python-Prompt-Toolkit</a>. Prompt Toolkit is awesome at
what it does, but the APIs for the library are still evolving. So I'm
hesitant to mark pgcli as 1.0, since pgcli will also be changing to keep up
with the changes in Prompt Toolkit. I'll probably release v1.0 when
Python-Prompt-Toolkit goes 1.0.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>What is the license for pgcli?</strong></p>
<p>BSD 3-clause license. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/amjith/pgcli/blob/master/LICENSE.txt">https://github.com/amjith/pgcli/blob/master/LICENSE.txt</a></p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>How can I get support for pgcli?</strong></p>
<p>There is a <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pgcli">mailing list</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://gitter.im/amjith/pgcli">Gitter</a> chat. We also track our bugs and
feature requests in Github <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/amjith/pgcli/issues">Issues</a> for this project.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>I found a bug, what do I do?</strong></p>
<p>Whoopsie Daisies! I'm sorry you encountered a bug. Please file a bug on
Github <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/amjith/pgcli/issues">Issues</a> for this project. I'll fix it asap.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>I have a feature request, what do I do?</strong></p>
<p>Sweet! Open a new item on Github <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/amjith/pgcli/issues">Issues</a>. Alternatively, you can take a stab
at implementing the new feature yourself. If you'd like some guidance, I'm
just an email away. Don't hesitate to <a class="reference external" href="./about">contact</a> me.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>I want to contribute to this project, how do I do that?</strong></p>
<p>Awesome! I thought you'd never ask. Here's a <a class="reference external" href="./develop">developer guide</a> that provides basic info on getting
started with local development. You're also welcome to <a class="reference external" href="./about">contact</a> me, if you
need some help getting started.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>What's your favorite cuisine?</strong></p>
<p>What's the point in having an FAQ if I don't include at least one frequently
asked question. So here it goes:</p>
<p>South Indian, North Indian, Thai, Mexican, Mediterranean, Ethiopian,
Japanese, Chinese, Sandwiches, Salads. In that order.</p>
